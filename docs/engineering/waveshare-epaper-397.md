## Hardware contract

| Function | Wiring |
|---|---|
| EPD SPI | SCLK 11, MOSI 12, CS 10, DC 9, RST 46, BUSY 3; 20 MHz |
| SDMMC | CLK 16, CMD 17, D0/D1/D2/D3 15/7/8/18; 4-bit |
| I²C | SDA 41, SCL 42; 400 kHz |
| RTC | PCF85063A at `0x51` |
| PMIC | AXP2101 at `0x34`; IRQ on GPIO38; ALDO3 supplies the EPD |
| Buttons | Back 0, Left 4, Function 5, Right 6; active-low |

Function single-click emits Confirm after the 300 ms double-click window. A
second short click starting within that window emits Back. Holding either press
for 300 ms instead holds Confirm from its physical press timestamp, so existing
business long-press actions work and GPIO5 never emits Power.

The side Power key is connected to the AXP2101 rather than a GPIO button. Its
GPIO38 IRQ is mapped to the standard Power input, including the existing short
Power action and hold-to-sleep behavior. Hold it for about one second to power
on; the boot gesture is ignored until its first release, so it may remain held
until the first screen is visible. A new runtime hold uses the existing 400 ms
software shutdown threshold (about 10 ms when short Power is set to Sleep),
while a continuous 4-second hold remains the PMIC hard-power-off fallback.
Audio, QMI8658, and SHTC3 are deliberately not initialized by this target.

GPIO4/GPIO6 short presses emit Left/Right on release. Holding either key for
650 ms instead emits and holds Up/Down respectively; releasing it produces only
the matching Up/Down release.

The panel uses the shared SSD1677 driver with a Waveshare-specific configuration.
FULL, HALF, and FAST select the controller's `0xF7`, `0xD7`, and `0xFF`
sequences respectively; HALF writes temperature `0x6A`. The shared asynchronous,
shadow-buffer, and window-refresh paths remain enabled. Normal antialiased page
turns first apply the `0xFF` B/W partial baseline, power the analog rails with a
separate `0xC0` activation, then drive only gray selector pixels through the
Waveshare-owned custom LUT and `0xCC`. The LUT initially matches X4 but remains
independent for panel-specific VCOM/VSH1 calibration. This path uses the existing
strip scratch and framebuffer only—no full-screen buffer or heap allocation.

The first page and periodic cleanup may still use HALF and visibly flash. Normal
pages use only the selector path and do not run a four-gray `0xD7`, 500 ms
settle, or hard-reset sequence. Deep sleep sends `0x10/0x01`; the existing
AXP2101 shutdown path then removes system power.

## Physical acceptance gate

- Confirm boot without panic/OOM and successful PSRAM, AXP2101, SDMMC, and RTC initialization.
- Visually check full, fast/windowed, half, and four-gray refreshes; repeat sleep/wake three times.
- Repeat Back, Left, Right, Function single/double/hold, and side Power gestures three times; one gesture must
  produce one action.
- Open an EPUB from SD, turn pages, and confirm progress/settings writes survive reboot.
- Set the RTC, reboot and fully power-cycle, then confirm restored time.
- Check battery percentage and charging; unplug USB, run on battery, shut down, then hold the side key until the first
  screen is visible before releasing it. Repeat three times and confirm the boot gesture never triggers shutdown.

Automated builds and serial logs do not substitute for the visual, button, or
battery checks above. Record incomplete checks as pending rather than accepted.
